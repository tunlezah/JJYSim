# JJY Simulator for M5Atom
## A JJY radio time signal simulator that runs on the ATOMS3 Lite and ATOM Lite/Matrix
Note: the standard ATOMS3 (the non-Lite model) is not supported.

### 2026-10-29 update
- Added [FLASHING.md](./FLASHING.md), a step-by-step guide to installing the software and uploading the firmware from Windows, macOS or Linux, with the Arduino IDE or arduino-cli.
- Rev.4/Rev.5 now also build with the newest versions: M5Stack board package 3.3.10 with M5Unified 0.2.28, M5GFX 0.2.35, FastLED 3.10.8 and WiFiManager 2.0.17. The board package 3.2.3 versions in the tables below still work.
- Rev.4/Rev.5: from arduino-esp32 3.3.9 on (M5Stack board package 3.3.9 and later), the USB serial driver of the ATOMS3 Lite gives up a write only after 20 tries that each wait the serial timeout. With the 1 ms timeout, every message to a connected PC that has stopped reading would wait about 20 ms; about 11 messages go out at the start of each minute before the first marker ends, so the marker could end 20 to 30 ms late. With these cores the timeout is now 0, which gives up at once; older cores keep 1 ms.
- The new versions have been compile-tested with arduino-cli, but not yet tested on hardware.
### 2026-10-24 update
- Rev.3, and Rev.5 on board package 2.x: the USB serial timeout on the ATOMS3 Lite is now 1 ms instead of 0. From arduino-esp32 2.0.15 up to 3.3.8, a timeout of 0 makes the serial driver retry for weeks when a connected PC stops reading, which would stop the time signal. The 2.0.14 core in M5Stack board package 2.1.4 was not affected. This concerns the default USB mode, "Hardware CDC and JTAG".
- Rev.4: the same serial timeout as Rev.5 was added, so a PC that stops reading can't delay the time signal.
- Rev.4/Rev.5: with board package 3.x, the carrier frequency printed at startup was 0, and the Rev.5 page could not show it, because it was read while the carrier was off. The carrier itself was correct.
- Rev.3/Rev.4/Rev.5: when the clock is set from the RTC at startup, daylight saving time is now taken into account for time zones that have it. JST is unaffected. The RTC holds no record of whether its time was written during daylight saving time, so if the device was switched off across a daylight-saving change and starts without NTP, the time can still be an hour off until the first NTP reply.
- All revisions were compile-checked with arduino-cli and the versions in the tables below. The 2026-10-21 and 2026-10-24 changes have not yet been tested on hardware.
### 2026-10-23 update
- Added Rev.5, which adds a web UI: check the simulator's status and change its settings from a browser. See section 9.
### 2026-10-21 update
- Rev.3/Rev.4: the JJY pulse timing now stays correct after each NTP time adjustment. Previously an adjustment could occasionally leave the timing on a slot boundary, corrupting pulses until the next adjustment.
- Rev.3/Rev.4: RTC times before 2017 are now ignored. An RTC last set by other software (e.g. M5Unified) used to produce a garbage clock; the device now waits for NTP instead.
- Rev.3: on the ATOMS3 Lite, serial output can no longer stall the time signal when a connected PC stops reading the serial port.
- Rev.4: the 40 kHz carrier now stays off until the time is valid.
- Rev.4: likely fix for the ATOM Lite/Matrix LED not lighting up. It has not been tested on hardware yet, so Rev.3 is still recommended for those boards.
- Rev.3/Rev.4: removed the GPIO0 workaround code, which never ran. `M5.begin()` already applies M5Unified's own countermeasure (see 8(6)).
### 2025-08-15 update
- Added Rev.4, which supports version 3.x of the M5Stack board package (Boards Manager). Rev.4 can be used with the ATOMS3 Lite.
- Updated `BF-018ARev3.ino` to improve detection of the M5Atom Lite/Matrix.
### 2025-03-03 update
- Updated `BF-018ARev3.ino` to adapt to a specification change in M5Unified: `cfg.serial_baudrate` is now set explicitly.
### 2024-03-20 update
- Fixed `BF-018ARev3.ino`: with the compiler warning level set higher than the default, the `%d` format specifiers in `Serial.printf()` calls were being reported as errors.
### 2024-03-12 update
- Updated to `BF-018ARev3`.

### Rev.5
- Folder: `BF-018ARev5`
- Rev.4 (with the 2026-10-21 fixes) plus a web UI (see section 9). As in Rev.3, serial output on the ATOMS3 Lite can't stall the time signal when a connected PC stops reading the serial port.
- ATOMS3 Lite: install version 3.x of the M5Stack board package, as for Rev.4.
- ATOM Lite/Matrix: version 2.x of the board package (with the Rev.3 library versions) or version 3.x.
- No extra libraries are needed: the web server, mDNS and settings storage come with the board package.
- Rev.5 has been compile-tested, but not yet tested on hardware.

## 1. Overview
This project uses an M5Atom to generate a simulated JJY signal for radio-controlled clocks, so you can set the time on clocks that are out of range of the real JJY broadcast. It gets the time via NTP over Wi-Fi and outputs the JJY signal on a GPIO pin.

Reference (Qiita, in Japanese): [Generating a simulated JJY time signal with Ticker on the M5StickC / M5Atom](https://qiita.com/BotanicFields/items/a78c80f947388caf0d36)

## 2. Software
For details of the development environment and libraries, see the section for each revision above. For step-by-step instructions on installing the software and uploading the firmware from Windows, macOS or Linux, see [FLASHING.md](./FLASHING.md).

## 3. Hardware
Transmitting the JJY signal requires an antenna. For experimenting, you can connect a wire about 1 m long between the signal output pin (GPIO22 on the ATOM Lite/Matrix, GPIO5 on the ATOMS3 Lite) and GND, with a resistor of around 1 kΩ in series. Run the wire right next to the radio-controlled clock and the clock will pick up the magnetic field from the wire.

### 3.1 Printed circuit board
We have made a printed circuit board (PCB) that an M5Atom can be mounted on.

## 4. Operation

- After power-on or a reset, the device first starts the Wi-Fi connection process.
- Once the Wi-Fi connection is established, it gets the date and time via NTP and starts transmitting the time signal.
- The built-in LED lets you see when the JJY signal is on. On the M5Atom Matrix, only LED 0 is used.  
Rev.1 behaviour (for the Rev.2 changes, see section 8):  
  >Blue: the JJY signal is being transmitted  
Red: lights up when the device fails to get the time via NTP  
Yellow: lights up when the Wi-Fi connection is lost (red + green)

## 5. Wi-Fi connection
Wi-Fi setup is handled by tzapu/WiFiManager. For details on how to use it, see the tzapu/WiFiManager documentation.

Reference: GitHub [tzapu/WiFiManager](https://github.com/tzapu/WiFiManager)

### Overview of the process:
> (1)	The M5Atom first tries to connect to the access point it connected to last time.  
(2) If it cannot connect, the M5Atom becomes an access point itself and waits for a smartphone or similar device to connect to it.
>> (2-1) On your smartphone (or similar device), connect to the access point that the M5Atom has created.  
Note: the SSID is a name based on the chip ID, and there is no password/key.  
(2-2) Open the IP address 192.168.4.1 in a web browser.  
(2-3) Enter the SSID/key of the network the M5Atom should connect to.

>(3)	The M5Atom connects to Wi-Fi using the SSID/key you entered.
## 5. LCD
The M5Atom version does not use an external LCD.

## 6. LED
The button turns LED monitoring on and off.

## 7. Serial monitor
The serial monitor lets you follow what the device is doing.

## 8. Miscellaneous

### (1) Wi-Fi connection recovery
We have added recovery handling that responds to the Wi-Fi status. Recovery can take a long time, for example 5 or 10 minutes, or until the Wi-Fi access point comes back. The aim is that you can simply leave the device alone and, before you know it, it will be working normally again. The recovery logic was worked out by trial and error and is not necessarily the best approach, so if you have any advice, please do let us know.

Reference (Qiita, in Japanese): [Trial and error with recovery handling for ESP32 Wi-Fi and tzapu/WiFiManager](https://qiita.com/BotanicFields/items/8a73101a8bfe51e57f67)

### (2) Using an RTC
Even if Wi-Fi is temporarily unavailable at power-on or after a reset, the device still transmits the JJY signal, based on the time held in the RTC (real-time clock). To make this possible, the RTC's time is updated whenever the time is synchronised via NTP, and the RTC keeps the current time based on its most recent update. To use this feature, connect an RTC unit to the M5Atom's GROVE port. In our experience, an RTC unit connected with a 20 cm GROVE cable was unreliable, whereas with a 10 cm cable it worked reliably.

Examples of RTC units you can use:
- [Real-Time Clock (RTC) Unit with HYM8563 for M5Stack](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/7482/) (Switch Science, in Japanese)
- [Real-Time Clock (RTC) Board for M5](https://www.switch-science.com/catalog/7170/) (Switch Science, in Japanese)

Reference (Qiita, in Japanese): [Catching NTP time synchronisation on the ESP32 to update an RTC](https://qiita.com/BotanicFields/items/f1e28af5a63e4ccf7023)

### (3) Erasing the stored SSID/key
To switch to a different Wi-Fi access point, you need to change the SSID/key settings. If the old access point has already been removed, WiFiManager's configuration portal starts automatically. If the old access point is still running, first erase the SSID/key stored in EEPROM; you can then enter new settings. To erase the SSID/key from EEPROM, hold down the button, press the reset button, and keep holding the button until the LED lights up green. At that point, the "configuration portal" is running.

### (4) Using 40 kHz
The real JJY signal is broadcast at 40 kHz from the transmitting station in Fukushima Prefecture and at 60 kHz from the station in Saga Prefecture. This project uses a PWM frequency of 40 kHz. The ESP32 cannot generate exactly 60 kHz, but it can generate a frequency quite close to it. In eastern Japan, setting the simulated JJY signal to 60 kHz lets you tell whether a clock has synchronised to the real signal from Fukushima or to the simulated one. To set the simulated signal to 60 kHz, change `jjy_frequency` in `BF-018ARevN.ino` to 60000. In Rev.5, choose 60 kHz on the web UI instead (section 9); the default is in `settings` in `BF-018ARev5.ino`.

```
// for TCO(Time Code Output)
const uint32_t jjy_frequency(40000); // 40kHz(east), 60kHz(west)
```

### (5) LED indications

- Wi-Fi connection status  
Any status other than `WL_CONNECTED` is shown by the red LED, either lit steadily or blinking.
- While the config portal is running, the green LED is lit.
- While waiting for NTP synchronisation, the green LED blinks.

Details: [JJY simulator status indications]

| # | State | Wi-Fi status | M5Atom LED: red | M5Atom LED: green | M5Atom LED: blue | M5StickC / M5StickC Plus: LCD |
|:-:|:--|:--|:-:|:-:|:-:|:--|
| 1 | Transmitting the JJY signal | - | - | - | Blinking | Red LED blinking |
| 2 | JJY signal stopped | - | - | - | Off | Red LED off |
| 3 | NTP sync complete, or RTC time is valid | - | - | Off | - | Shows the local time |
| 4 | Waiting for NTP sync | - | - | Slow blink | - | Shows "Localtime not ready" |
| 5 | Wi-Fi SSID/key entry (config portal) in progress | - | - | On | - | Shows the config portal's SSID and IP address |
| 6 | Wi-Fi connected | `WL_CONNECTED` | Off | - | - | Shows the SSID of the connected network and the device's own IP address |
| 7 | Wi-Fi access point not found | `WL_NO_SSID_AVAIL` | Slow blink | - | - | Shows `WL_NO_SSID_AVAIL` |
| 8 | Wi-Fi disconnected | `WL_DISCONNECTED` | Fast blink | - | - | Shows `WL_DISCONNECTED` |
| 9 | Wi-Fi status changing | `WL_CONNECTION_LOST`, `WL_IDLE_STATE`, etc. | On | - | - | Shows `WL_CONNECTION_LOST`, `WL_IDLE_STATE`, etc. |

When the red, green and blue LEDs are lit or blinking at the same time, they can combine to show colours such as yellow or purple. For example, when the device is waiting for the Wi-Fi access point (`WL_NO_SSID_AVAIL`) and also waiting for NTP sync, the LED blinks slowly in yellow.

### (6) Workaround for unstable Wi-Fi connections on the M5Atom

The M5Atom has a problem where its Wi-Fi output power drops and the connection becomes unstable. Hopefully this is being addressed with improved firmware for the CH552 chip that handles USB-to-serial conversion, but many units that have already shipped do not have the fix. As a workaround, code that drives GPIO0 LOW has been added at the start of `setup()`. In Rev.3 and later, M5Unified's `M5.begin()` handles this instead, by driving GPIO0 HIGH.

### (7) Differences from the real JJY signal
At minutes 15 and 45 the real JJY sends its call sign in Morse code during seconds 40 to 48 and a notice of planned transmission interruptions in seconds 50 to 55, in place of the year, day-of-week and leap-second bits. The simulator sends the normal time code every minute. The simulator also switches the carrier fully off between pulses, where the real signal drops to 10% of its amplitude. Radio-controlled clocks and watches are generally tolerant of both, but this has not been verified for every model.

## 9. Web UI (Rev.5)
Rev.5 serves a status and settings page. In a browser on the same network, open `http://jjy-sim.local/`, or the device's IP address (printed in the serial monitor at startup, and shown in your router's client list).

The page shows:
- the time being transmitted, and the current minute's time code as it goes out
- what the status LED means at the moment, with a switch for LED monitoring (the same as the button)
- the Wi-Fi, NTP and RTC status, uptime and free memory
- the timing statistics of the 100 ms slots that the firmware prints every minute
- the serial log, so you don't need a USB connection to follow what the device is doing

Settings you can change on the page (stored in flash, and applied when the device restarts):
- carrier frequency: 40 kHz or 60 kHz (see 8(4))
- time zone, as a POSIX TZ string. A JJY clock displays whatever local time it receives, so outside Japan you can choose your own time zone. Watches with a home-city setting, for example Citizen multi-band models, choose the station by the home city: only a city that uses the Japan station (Tokyo; on some models also Adelaide, Sydney, Nouméa and Auckland) makes the watch listen for JJY at all, and the watch then treats the received time as Japan time and converts it to the home city's offset. With a European, American or Chinese home city the watch listens for a different station and will never sync to this simulator. The simplest setup is the home city on Tokyo and your own time zone here. The JJY code carries no summer-time flag, so a time zone with daylight saving rules already includes the hour shift: set the watch's own summer time to OFF so the hour is not added again.
- NTP server

The defaults are in `settings` at the top of `BF-018ARev5.ino`.

### (1) Password
Changing anything from the page needs a password. Set `web_password` in `BF-018ARev5.ino` before uploading; the user name is `admin` (`web_user`). While `web_password` is empty, the page is read-only. The browser asks for the password the first time you change something (HTTP Digest authentication). The page uses plain HTTP, so use it on a network you trust.

### (2) Erasing the stored SSID/key from the page
"Forget Wi-Fi network" on the page does the same as holding the button at reset (see 8(3)): the device restarts with its configuration portal running.

### (3) Load on the M5Atom
The web UI adds about 90 KB of flash (on the ATOMS3 Lite, 40% of the 3 MB app partition is used with board package 3.2.3 and 41% with 3.3.10) and about 13 KB of RAM. The JJY signal is generated by the Ticker, separately from the web server, which runs in `loop()`; the timing statistics on the page show whether anything disturbs it. While a browser has the page open, it asks the device for its status once a second (about 1 KB each time).

### (4) Host name
The name `jjy-sim` is set by `web_hostname`. Some devices, for example some Android phones, can't resolve `.local` names; use the IP address instead.
